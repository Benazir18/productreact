            to 28.49%. You must elect to use ACMI at checkout. If you buy an
            ACMI-eligible product with a one-time payment on Apple Card at
            checkout, that purchase is subject to your Apple Card’s variable
            APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on items purchased
            using ACMI are subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the

            will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the
            monthly payment amount. ACMI is subject to change at any time for
            any reason, including but not limited to installment term lengths
            and eligible products. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement(Opens

            about the recycled content of its products at different levels of
            fidelity, based on the level of independent data verification. The
            bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified and thus verified
            by an independent third party. Less than 5% ofthe total mass shipped
            in Apple products in fiscal year 2022 contains recycled content that
            is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported by the
            supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning
            it has been reported by the supplier based on production and
            allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in
            alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently include
            industry-average recycled content, which may result in
            underreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material
            shipped in products is driven by product material composition and
            total sales —as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content
            percentage may fluctuate basedon the number and type of products
            sold each year. 8. Based on sales-weighted averages of Mac, iPad,
            iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV,HomePod, AirPods, and Beats. 9.
            Apple’s goal to eliminate plastic from packaging includes retail
            bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels
            and in-box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part
            of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service
            modules (with the exception of plastics needed to protect items from
            electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products
            and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal does not include the inks,
            coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. Responsible sourcing
            of wood fiber is defined in Apple’s Responsible Fiber Specification.
            We consider wood fibers to include bamboo. For more information
